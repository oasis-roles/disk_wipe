disk_wipe
===========

This role is not idempotent and it is recommended that it be run in an isolated
playbook to prevent disks from getting re-wiped during additional runs.
The role is intended to be used when you are preparing nodes for deployment
to ensure there is no stale, unwanted, or pre-existing data.

It will perform the following tasks:
1. Overwrite the disk(s) with zeros using shred command with specified byte size.
2. Erase the the disk signature(s) using wipefs.

IMPORTANT:
Extreme caution must be used to avoid running this role against the wrong disk(s).
Specifying the wrong disk or disks can lead to corruption and data loss.
Do not specify any disk that hosts your operating system or contains any data you may need.

Requirements
------------

Ansible 2.4 or higher

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or equivalent
